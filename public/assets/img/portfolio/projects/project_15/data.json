    "par1": "Redesign, Interior Design and supervision of construction works for \"UNI CLINIC\" / pediatric clinic, it is a primary care and multi-specialty clinic located south in the city of Prishtina. The clinic contains a waiting area, four medical checking rooms, a laboratory and toilets. The design standards and the materials used in the interior of the clinic follow the best applicable medical norms and with the minimum amount of maintenance, taking into account specific conditions and different operational environments. The clinic is designed to provide the most effective and highest quality healthcare and the patients always come first, both child's safety and comfort very seriously. The clinic is not a happy place to go, or we should say, no clinic could make people feel happy: the cold registration desk, the worrisome waiting chairs and the disturbing doors of the clinic rooms; the whole space is filled with a sense of distrust between doctors and patients. ",
    "par2": "We hoped to express the idea that medical space needs to show trust and hope through different design insights. There should be warmth, goodwill, openness, communication and smile in life, wishing that all of these could be shown within this space. However, from a spiritual aspect, the clinic should be a place which brings hope, or at least should be a warm space. It might not be a delightful thing to go to the clinic, so we tried to change this space through design, bringing it some kind of warmth and caring. Because there's warmth, life should have been happier.",
