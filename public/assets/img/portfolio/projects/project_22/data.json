    "name": "Footbridge over M2",
    "par1": "The footbridge is located near the Prishtina main bus station on regional road M2 and the plot for the building is quite limited on both sides of the road. The ramps and stairs on both sides of the footbridge are designed parallel to the roads. The function of the footbridge is to enable pedestrians to move safely from one side of the road/city to the other side. Especially it is necessary for the weakest category of citizens, such as the elderly, children and people with special needs. ",
    "par2": "The architectural solution of the footbridge is significantly conditioned by the very narrow space in which it is located, especially this applies to the ramps, which, although designed as a double are 40 meters long. The ramps together with the stairs on the East-West axes have a width of 52.00m, while the North-South direction is 59.55m long. The function of the building is very simple, on the ground floor, the stairs and ramps start up to the level 5.44 m ' in height, where they are connected with the footbridge and the longitudinal axes of the bridge overhanging the M2 regional road, by request of the investor the footbridge is designed as closed while the stairs are covered.",
